# 2.1 - Transactions and Blocks

This chapter explains how transactions and blocks work within the Sparq blockchain.

## Transactions

We have two types of transactions: *block* transactions and *Validator* transactions, hereby named **TxBlock** and **TxValidator**. Both classes are declared in `utils/tx.h`.

The implementation logic and details for transactions are derived from the "Account" model, used by Ethereum and implemented mainly by the [Aleth](https://github.com/ethereum/aleth) library, unlike the "UTXO" model used by Bitcoin and derived chains.

### How transactions are parsed

Regardless of the type, there are two ways a transaction can be parsed from a bytes string:

* *Directly from RLP* (see [5-1](../ch5/5-1.md) for more info)
  * Requires deriving the sender (`from`) address and a validity check using secp256k1
  * *Not* included in a block, which means it's a new transaction coming from the network
  * Equivalent to Ethereum's `rawTransaction`
* *Directly from the database*
  * Considered trustworthy since it already went through the process above
  * *Is* included in a block, therefore it's part of the blockchain

### Transaction structure

Depending on the type, a transaction will contain the following data fields after being parsed:

* **(TxBlock only) to** - receiver address (the one that received the funds)
* **(Both) from** - sender address (the one that sent the funds)
* **(Both) data** - arbitrary data field, generally used in contracts
* **(Both) chainId** - unique blockchain ID where the transaction is made
  * e.g. `43114` = Avalanche C-Chain, `43113` = Avalanche Fuji Testnet, etc.
* **(TxValidator only) nHeight** - height of the block where the transaction is included
* **(TxBlock only) nonce** - number of the transaction made from the sender address
  * Always starts at 0, so a nonce of `4` means this would be the *fifth* transaction made by the given address
* **(TxBlock only) value** - transaction value in its lowest unit
  * e.g. "satoshi" for BTC, "Wei" for ETH, etc. - "100000000" satoshis would be 1.0 BTC, "5000000000" Wei would be 0.000000005 ETH (or 5 gwei), so on and so forth
  * Since we're using an Ethereum-based format, we commonly refer to its terminology, so "value" is in "Wei"
* **(TxBlock only) gasLimit** - maximum limit of gas units that the transaction will use, in Wei (e.g. "21000")
  * If the transaction uses more than this limit, it will automatically fail - the original transaction value won't be spent, but what was already spent as gas is lost
* **(TxBlock only) maxPriorityFeePerGas** - vaid paid as incentive for miners to incentivize them to include the transaction, as per [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) definition
  * This is implemented but actively ignored in Sparq altogether since we don't have "miners", therefore only maxFeePerGas is counted
* **(TxBlock only) maxFeePerGas** - value paid by every unit of gas, in Gwei (e.g. "15" = 15000000000 Wei)
  * The total transaction fee is calculated as (gasLimit * maxFeePerGas) - e.g. 21000 * 15000000000 = 0.000315 ETH
* **(Both)** ECDSA signature (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for validating transaction integrity, split in three:
  * **r** - first half of the ECDSA signature (32 hex bytes)
  * **s** - second half of the ECDSA signature (32 hex bytes)
  * **v** - recovery ID (1 hex byte)

## Blocks

The **Block** class, declared in `utils/block.h`, is the abstraction of a block in the blockchain.

The class only contains the bare structure and data of a block - it doesn't do any kind of operation, validation or verification on it. That's [rdPoS](../ch4/4-2.md) territory.

### Block structure

Conceptually, a block has the following structure:

* Validator signature
* Header:
  * Previous block hash (a hash of the whole header, signed by the Validator)
  * "Randomness" (a random seed generated by [RandomGen](../ch2/2-3.md) during block creation)
  * Validator Tx Merkle Tree (to verify the integrity of Validator transactions)
  * Block Tx Merkle Tree (to verify the integrity of Block transactions)
  * UNIX timestamp of the block, in microseconds
  * Block height (commonly known as `nHeight`)
* Content:
  * Number of Validator transactions
  * Number of block transactions
  * List of Validator transactions
  * List of block transactions

In practice, a block is simply a serialized bytes string, transmitted through the network and stored in the blockchain, so it's up to the code logic to parse said details.

Another way to see the block in a more "raw" format is like this:

```
65 bytes - Validator signature
Header:
  32 bytes - Previous block hash
  32 bytes - "Randomness"
  32 bytes - Validator Tx Merkle Tree
  32 bytes - Block Tx Merkle Tree
  8 bytes - Timestamp
  8 bytes - Block height
Content:
  8 bytes - Number of Validator transactions
  8 bytes - Number of block transactions
  8 bytes - Offset of Validator transactions array
  8 bytes - Offset of block transactions array
  [
    4 bytes - Validator transaction size
    N bytes - Validator transaction
    ...
  ]
  [
    4 bytes - Block transaction size
    N bytes - Block transaction
    ...
  ]
```

Blocks transmitted on the network *must* have the Validator signature, which is part of the block but is *outside* its structure. This is intentional, so the block header can be hashed and signed on its own without hashing the signature along with it.

### Raw block header analysis

A "raw" block would look something like this:
