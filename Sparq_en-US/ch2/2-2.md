# 2.2 - Implementation details

The previous subchapters paint a more holistic view of the OrbiterSDK project, as most components are pretty straight-forward to understand, and developers are expected to use the [Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl) documentation as a reference to further understand how the project works.

However, some components are particularly denser and/or complex enough that they warrant their own separated explanations. The following subchapters will dive deeper into them. Information about anything related to smart contracts is separated into its own chapter.
