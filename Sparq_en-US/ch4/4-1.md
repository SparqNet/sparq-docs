# 4.1 - Storage

The **Storage** class, declared in `core/storage.h`, represents the blockchain's history.

It maintains a collection of blocks approved and validated by the network, other nodes, or itself. Those blocks store transactions, contracts, accounts, and can't be altered once they're in the blockchain, only searched for or read from.

On node initialization, a history of up to 1000 of the most recent blocks is loaded into memory. Those blocks were stored in a previous initialization in the [database](../ch2/2-4.md). If there are no blocks (e.g. blockchain was just deployed and initialized for the first time), a "genesis" block is automatically created and loaded in memory.

Once received from the network, the blocks and their transactions are stored momentarily in memory. After up to 1000 blocks are stored in memory, or after a certain time, older blocks are periodically saved to the database. This makes the blockchain lightweight memory-wise, thus extremely responsive.

Searching for and reading from blocks in history is done in several places in the system, so we can conclude the Storage and DB classes together are the end point of the blockchain's operations history.
