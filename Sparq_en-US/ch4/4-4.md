# 4.4 - State

The **State** class, declared in `core/state.h`, is responsible for maintaining the state of the blockchain, as well as a few shared inner variables.

A blockchain's "state" is commonly referred to the state of accounts, their balances and nonces, transactions, token balances and contracts at the current block in the network.

A node's state and its data can only be altered through the process of block creation, either by creating a block itself, or receiving one from the network.

In Sparq's case, the class is often used for querying account data (current balance and nonce) and also processing and validating blocks and their transactions, following requirements such as (not limited to, but those are some of the most common):

* Ensuring replay protection (e.g. checking if the transaction has already been validated)
* Checking if the sender address exists and has enough balance to make the transaction
* Checking if the sender address nonce is valid (if it matches what was sent in the transaction)
* Checking if the transaction is not already in the mempool, thus avoiding double spends

Not all functions from the class update the state. Check the Doxygen docs for more info on that.
