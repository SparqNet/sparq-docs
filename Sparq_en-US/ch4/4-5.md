# 4.5 - Blockchain

TODO: the details here may be slightly outdated and/or missing - check better later

The **Blockchain** class, declared in `core/blockchain.h`, acts as the mother class that unites all the other components described throughout the docs, such as:

* [The database](ch2/2-4.md)
* [The blockchain state](ch4/4-4.md)
* [The blockchain history/storage](ch4/4-1.md)
* [The SnowmanVM abstraction layer](ch4/4-3.md) (for interfacing with AvalancheGo)
* [The rdPoS protocol](ch4/4-2.md)
* The [gRPC](), [HTTP]() and [P2P]() servers

Think of it as "the power button on Sparq's PC case" - its objective is to be the entry point of the system and act as a mediator for the other components, passing data around to each other.

## Initialization

When booting the blockchain, the following routine is executed:

* Set up a random port for the gRPC server
* Signal the AvalancheGo daemon while listening on the given random port
* Wait for AvalancheGo to answer
* Once it does, parse the latest block, and initialize the other components

## Shutdown

When requested to be shut down, the following routine is executed:

* Write the contents of State and Storage to the database
* Close the database
* Signal the HTTP server to shut down and wait for it
* Once the HTTP server is shutdown, exit
