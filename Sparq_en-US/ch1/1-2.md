# 1.2 - How consensus works

Being the implementation of a whole blockchain by itself, Sparq has to follow a set of rules to reach consensus in transactions and blocks, much like any other blockchain.

## rdPoS

To keep consensus on such a blazing fast network without tripping up and/or having to deal with rollbacks, we need a *random deterministic block creation* that allows only a given node to create a block for a given time, eliminating the risk of a block race condition in the network.

This is implemented in Sparq as its own Avalanche Subnet-compatible consensus algorithm, called **rdPoS (Random Deterministic Proof of Stake)**, which deals with block congestion and random number generation, and works with the concept of **Validators** and **Sentinels**.

Full details on how it all it works can be seen [here](../ch4/4-2.md).

## Validators

Validators are nodes set up by the community that have locked at least 10000 SPARQ tokens through an `addValidator` transaction.

They create blocks, the "randomness" seed used to create them, and are responsible for gathering, signing and verifying them.

## Sentinels

Sentinels are similar to Validators, except they cannot create blocks nor act on their own, but rather work together with Validators to drive the network forward.

It is required that both randomly selected Validators and Sentinels send the same data to the requester, otherwise they'll be reported to the network as a malicious node.

Sparq Labs Inc. hosts them to ensure that won't happen.
