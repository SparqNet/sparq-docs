# Sparq - EN-US

This folder contains an introduction to the concepts of the Sparq network, from the most basic to the most detailed.

*This is a living repository* - docs for fixed versions are tagged accordingly on the `main` branch, while the `development` branch is always keeping up with changes made in the project's own development branch. Always check the branch and tag you're in.
