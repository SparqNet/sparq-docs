# 3.4 - Solidity ABI

Sparq is a *native* blockchain and has no EVM, but the vast majority of the smart contract ecossystem operates and depends on [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest) - not only the contracts themselves but also the data they share across each other.

The **ABI** namespace, declared in `contract/abi.h`, contains a few classes with several Solidity ABI-related operations for managing and manipulating data in Solidity format.

This is only an overview, check the Doxygen docs for more details on how those classes work.

## Solidity types

The **Types** enum contains the supported Solidity data types. Each value has an intrinsic equivalency with both the Solidity data type and the native C++ data type that it represents:

| Enum       | Solidity  | C++                                 |
|:----------:|:---------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| uint256    | uint256   | uint256_t                           |
| uint256Arr | uint256[] | std::vector\<uint256_t>             |
| address    | address   | [Address](ch2/2-5.md)               |
| addressArr | address[] | std::vector\<[Address](ch2/2-5.md)> |
| bool       | bool      | bool                                |
| boolArr    | bool[]    | std::vector\<bool>                  |
| bytes      | bytes     | std::string                         |
| bytesArr   | bytes[]   | std::vector\<std::string>           |
| string     | string    | std::string                         |
| stringArr  | string[]  | std::vector\<std::string>           |

Note that `bytes` and `string` on Solidity use the same type `std::string` on C++. This is because both Solidity `bytes` and `string` types are parsed the exact same way, and `std::string` is used extensively for both raw byte and literal strings.

The difference lies in the treatment - `bytes` is strictly treated as a hex string (it REQUIRES the "0x" prefix), while `string` does not (it REQUIRES NOT having the "0x" prefix). This is all done internally by the classes below, so no need to worry.

## The Encoder class

The **Encoder** class is responsible for encoding and packing native C++ data types into Solidity ABI-formatted strings.

The class automatically does the encoding on the constructor, so all you have to do is invoke it with a list of the supported types above (in the C++ column), and optionally a string with the functor (the full function header with no spaces between arguments, e.g. `func(type1,type2)`).

Here's an example:

```c++
ABI::Encoder e(
  {1000000000000000000, Address(std::string("0x1a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b1a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b"), false)},
  "transfer(uint256,address)"
);
std::cout << e.getData() << std::endl;
$ b7760c8f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000001a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b1a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b
```

## The Decoder class

The **Decoder** class is responsible for decoding Solidity ABI-formatted strings back to native C++ data types.

The class automatically does the decoding on the constructor, so all you have to do is invoke it with the Solidity string and a list with the respective enum types, in order. Note that the Solidity string has to be in **raw bytes** format.

Here's an example:

```c++
ABI::Decoder d(
  {ABI::Types::uint256, ABI::Types::address},
  Hex(std::string("0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a76400000000000000000000000000001a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b1a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b")).bytes()
);
uint256_t value = d.getData<uint256_t>(0);
Address to = d.getData<Address>(1);
std::cout << value << std::endl;
std::cout << to.hex().get() << std::endl;
$ 1000000000000000000
$ 1a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b1a2b3c4d5e6f7e8d9c0b
```

## The JSONEncoder class

The **JSONEncoder** class acts the same way as the Encoder class, however it deals strictly with JSON objects instead of raw byte strings, so the workflow here is a little different.

First, the constructor needs a JSON object which would contain the contract's interface. Once constructed, the class can parse the function header and another JSON object that contains the arguments to this function.

TODO: some examples here would be nice
