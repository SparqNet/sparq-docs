# 3.3 - Setting up the development environment

This subchapter explains how to set up [OrbiterSDK](https://github.com/SparqNet/orbitersdk-cpp), our open-core blockchain SDK project, to start creating and deploying your contracts in it. This is an overview/"more approachable" version of the project's README.md file - be sure to read it as well.

You're able to tweak out almost everything related to the SDK. We offer pre-existing solutions for all of those, but you are free to hack into them as you wish, just be careful not to break it apart. That includes but it isn't limited to:

* Consensus
* Block processing
* Transaction processing
* Contract processing
* Communication between nodes, etc.

As OrbiterSDK is not running a virtual machine of any kind, and contracts are natively compiled with the blockchain itself, which requires them to exist alongside the project's source code, it is impossible to submit a transaction with bytecode for a respective contract. Because of that, we strongly encourage you to fork the project, play around with the code and start developing your own contracts locally.

## Developing on Docker (recommended)

If you want to develop on Docker, there is a Dockerfile that will build the project and deploy the network. It will also install nano for convenience. The Dockerfile is located on the root of the repository.

First, you need to install Docker on your machine. You can find the instructions for your OS here:

* [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

After installing Docker, you need to build the image. To do this, go to the root of the repository and run the following command:

* For Linux: `sudo docker build -t orbitersdk-cpp-dev:latest .`
* For Windows/Mac: `docker build -t orbitersdk-cpp-dev:latest .`

This will build the image and tag it as `orbitersdk-cpp-dev:latest`. You can change the tag to whatever you want, but remember to change it on the next step.

After building the image, you can run it with the following command:

* For Linux:

```bash
    sudo docker run -it -v /path/to/your/sdk:/orbitersdk-cpp -p 8080-8099:8080-8099 -p 8110-8111:8110-8111 orbitersdk-cpp-dev:latest
```

* For Windows/Mac:

```bash
    docker run -it -v /path/to/your/sdk:/orbitersdk-cpp -p 8080-8099:8080-8099 -p 8110-8111:8110-8111 orbitersdk-cpp-dev:latest
```

When running the container, you need to expose the ports that you want to use. The example above exposes the ports 8080-8099 and 8110-8111, which are the ports used by the nodes. Also, you need to mount the folder where you have the SDK, in this case, the folder is `/path/to/your/sdk`. It's a good practice to save the SDK path on an environment variable, so you can use it on the command above this way:

```bash
    docker run -it -v $SDK_PATH:/orbitersdk-cpp  -p 8080-8099:8080-8099 -p 8110-8111:8110-8111 orbitersdk-cpp-dev:latest
```

Where `$SDK_PATH` is the environment variable that contains the path to the SDK folder.

After running the container, you will be the root user on the container. You can now develop on the container, and build and deploy the network with the scripts provided on the `scripts` folder.

Remember that we are using our local SDK repo as a volume, so every change in the local folder will be reflected to the container in real time, and vice-versa. Also, you can integrate the container with your favorite IDE or editor, for example, you can use VSCode with the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) to develop on the container.

* **VSCode + Docker extension**

To develop on the container with VSCode, you need to install the [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) and configure it to use the container. After installing it, you can just rigth click on `Dockerfile` and select `Build Image...` to build the image. After building the image, you can click on the Docker extension icon, and right click on the conatiner that you just built. Select `Run Interactive` to run the container. VSCode will open a terminal inside the container and you can start developing on it. Also, you can browse the files on the container and edit directly there. The GIF below shows how to build and run the container with VSCode.

## Forking

In order to fork the project, you can head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SparqNet/orbitersdk-cpp) and click on the "Fork" button. After that, you can clone your forked repository and start developing on your own.

## Manually setup development environment

TODO: update this when extrev is merged

You can follow this steps if you want to build the SDK in your own system. OrbiterSDK requires several dependencies (as of v0.0.2):

* **GCC** with support for **C++20** or higher
* **CMake 3.19.0** or higher
* **Abseil (absl)**
* **Boost 1.74** or higher (components: *chrono, filesystem, program-options, system, thread, nowide*)
* **CryptoPP 8.2.0** or higher
* **gRPC** + **Protobuf 3.12** or higher + **libc-ares**
* **LevelDB** + **libsnappy**
* **libscrypt**
* **OpenSSL 1.1.1**
* **zlib**

Here's a one-liner that should work on Debian 11 (Bullseye) or greater, as well as its derived distributions:

```bash
sudo apt install git build-essential cmake tmux clang-tidy autoconf libtool pkg-config libabsl-dev libboost-all-dev libc-ares-dev libcrypto++-dev libgrpc-dev libgrpc++-dev libleveldb-dev libscrypt-dev libsnappy-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev openssl protobuf-compiler protobuf-compiler-grpc
```

### CMake caveat

Note that Debian 11 specifically ships CMake *3.18.4*, which is not enough for OrbiterSDK's *3.19.0* requirement. In this case, you'll need to either install it separately, or compile it from source.

First, make sure you've uninstalled the system's CMake with `sudo apt purge cmake`, to avoid conflicts.

We recommend downloading the installer from [CMake's website](https://cmake.org/download/), installing it to somewhere like `/opt` and symlinking it to `/usr/local`, like so (change `$CMAKEVER` for the version number you wish):

```bash
# Assume CMAKEVER=3.19.0
# Download CMake installer
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v$CMAKEVER/cmake-$CMAKEVER-linux-x86_64.sh
# Make it executable
chmod +x ./cmake-$CMAKEVER-linux-x86_64.sh
# Run it with the following parameters
sudo ./cmake-$CMAKEVER-linux-x86_64.sh --prefix=/opt --include-subdir --skip-license
# Symlink the CMake executable so you can call it directly
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/cmake /opt/cmake-$CMAKEVER-linux-x86_64/bin/cmake
# Symlink other binaries here if you wish
```

If you want to compile it from source, follow the steps below. They will install CMake 3.26.3, but you can change the version to any other you want like it was done above:

```bash
# Download CMake source
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.3/cmake-3.26.3.tar.gz
# Extract the cmake-3.26.3.tar.gz file
tar -zxvf cmake-3.26.3.tar.gz
# Go to the extracted directory
cd cmake-3.26.3
# Bootstrap CMake (use --parallel=X where X is the number of cores you want to use to speed up the process)
./bootstrap --parallel=$(nproc)
# Compile CMake (use -jX where X is the number of cores you want to use to speed up the process)
make -j$(nproc)
# Install CMake
sudo make install
```

## Compiling

After forking the project, you can now setup your own local testnet. This is strongly recommended, as it will ensure your environment is properly setup and that you are able to compile the project with your contracts in it.

Clone your forked repository by following the steps below:

```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/orbitersdk-cpp.git
# Go to the project directory
cd orbitersdk-cpp
# add remote repository as upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SparqNet/orbitersdk-cpp
# Fetch all tags
git fetch --tags upstream
# Update all tags within your repository
git push -f --tags
# Switch to a branch for contract development on latest release (change the version accordingly)
git checkout -b contract-development v0.0.2
```

After cloning, the following commands will build the project within the folder which `scripts/AIO-setup.sh` (a script that automatically builds and deploys a local testnet) will use later.

```bash
# Create the folder and enter it
mkdir build_local_testnet && cd build_local_testnet
# Configure cmake (DEBUG=ON will enable debug symbols and address sanitizer)
cmake -DDEBUG=ON ..
# Build the project - you can use either one of the lines below
make -j$(nproc)
# or...
cmake --build . -- -j$(nproc)
```

After building, you can optionally run a test bench with the following command: `./orbitersdkd-tests -d yes` (the `-d yes` parameter will give a verbose output). You can also use filter tags to test specific parts of the project (e.g. `./orbitersdkd-tests [utils] -d yes` will test only the components inside the `src/utils` folder).

TODO: revise all usable tags in tests later and list them here

## Deploying

TODO: shouldn't the README info be all here anyway?

To deploy your local testnet, `cd` back to the project's root folder and run `./scripts/AIO-setup.sh`. The script will setup a local testnet with the [following information](https://github.com/SparqNet/orbitersdk-cpp#setting-up-a-local-network). Once the local testnet is deployed, you can connect any Web3 client to it. We recommend using [Metamask](https://metamask.io) as it is the most popular one, but you're free to use any other client you wish.

Running the script again will stop the testnet, rebuild it, replace it and restart it on the spot. If you wish to manually stop the testnet for some reason, call `tmux kill-server` (as we use tmux to properly deploy it). You can also read the script to find out the specific names of the tmux sessions to manually restart or stop accordingly.

## MetaMask config

Here's how to configure MetaMask to connect to your local testnet:

| Field | Value                    |
| :--- |:-------------------------|
| Network Name | OrbiterSDK Local Testnet |
| New RPC URL | http://127.0.0.1:8090    |
| Chain ID | 808080                   |
| Currency Symbol | SPARQ                    |

![MetamaskNetworkConfiguration](img/MetamaskNetworkConfiguration.png)

Then, import the following private key for the Chain Owner account: `0xe89ef6409c467285bcae9f80ab1cfeb3487cfe61ab28fb7d36443e1daa0c2867`. This account contains 1000 SPARQ Tokens from the get go and can call the `ContractManager` contract.
