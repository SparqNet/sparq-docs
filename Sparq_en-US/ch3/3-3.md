# 3.3 - Setting up the development environment

### Installing dependencies.
OrbiterSDK requires several dependencies, such as:

* **GCC** with support for **C++20** or higher
* **CMake 3.19.0** or higher
* **Abseil (absl)**
* **Boost 1.74** or higher (components: *chrono, filesystem, program-options, system, thread, nowide*)
* **CryptoPP 8.2.0** or higher
* **gRPC** + **Protobuf 3.12** or higher + **libc-ares**
* **LevelDB** + **libsnappy**
* **libscrypt**
* **OpenSSL 1.1.1**
* **zlib**

The following instructions are for Debian 11 (Bulleyes) or newer, but they should work on any Debian-based distribution.
```bash 
sudo apt install build-essential cmake tmux clang-tidy autoconf libtool pkg-config libabsl-dev libboost-all-dev libc-ares-dev libcrypto++-dev libgrpc-dev libgrpc++-dev libleveldb-dev libscrypt-dev libsnappy-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev openssl protobuf-compiler protobuf-compiler-grpc
```
**OBS:** Debian 11 ships CMake 3.18.4, which is not compatible with OrbiterSDK, so you will need to compile CMake from source. The following instructions  will install CMake 3.26.3, but you can change the version to any other you want.
```bash
## Uninstall the current CMake version
sudo apt remove --purge cmake
## Download CMake source.
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.3/cmake-3.26.3.tar.gz
## Extract the cmake-3.26.3.tar.gz file.
tar -zxvf cmake-3.26.3.tar.gz
## Go to the extracted directory.
cd cmake-3.26.3
## Bootstrap CMake (use --parallel=X where X is the number of cores you want to use to speed up the process).
./bootstrap --parallel=$(nproc)
## Compile CMake (use -jX where X is the number of cores you want to use to speed up the process).
make -j$(nproc)
## Install CMake.
sudo make install
```

### Forking the Project

The OrbiterSDK is a blockchain SDK project with open core in mind, that means, you are able to tweak out almost everything related with your blockchain, that includes but it isn't limited to: consensus, block processing, transaction processing, contract processing, communication between nodes, etc, we offer already pre-existing solutions for all of those, but you are free to change them as you wish as long you don't break your own blockchain, besides that, contracts are compiled down with the blockchain itself, requiring them to be with the project source code, as OrbiterSDK is not running a virtual machine, it is impossible to submit a transaction with bytecode for a respective contract.

Because of that, we strongly encourage you to fork the project and start developing your own contracts, in order to fork the project, you can head over to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SparqNet/OrbiterSDK-cpp) and click on the "Fork" button, after that, you can clone your forked repository and start developing your own contracts.

### Compiling the Project.

After forking the project, you are now able to setup your own local testnet, this is strongly recommended as it will verify if your environment is properly setup and if you are able to compile the project with your contracts.

Clone your forked repository and go to the project directory.
```bash
## Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/orbitersdk-cpp.git
## Go to the project directory
cd orbitersdk-cpp
## Fetch all tags
git fetch --tags upstream
## Switch to a branch for contract development on latest release.
git checkout -b contract-development v0.0.1
```

After cloning, you are able to build the project, the following command will build the project within the folder which ```AIO-setup.sh``` (a script to automatically setup a local testnet network) will use later.

```bash
## Create the folder and enter it
mkdir build_local_testnet && cd build_local_testnet
## Configure cmake (DEBUG=ON will enable debug symbols and address sanitizer)
cmake -DDEBUG=ON
## Build the project
make -j$(nproc)
```

After building the project, if desired to run the tests, you can run the following command:
```bash
./orbitersdkd-tests -d yes
```

Or setup a local testnet network with the following command:
```bash
cd .. && ./scripts/AIO-setup.sh
```

The ```AIO-setup.sh``` script will setup a local testnet network with the [following information](https://github.com/SparqNet/orbitersdk-cpp#setting-up-a-local-network)

You are able to connect any web3 client to the local testnet network, we recommend using [Metamask](https://metamask.io) as it is the most popular web3 client, but you can use any other web3 client you want.

Metamask Network Configuration:

| Field | Value                    |
| :--- |:-------------------------|
| Network Name | OrbiterSDK Local Testnet |
| New RPC URL | http://127.0.0.1:8090    |
| Chain ID | 808080                   |
| Currency Symbol | SPARQ                    |

Import the following private key for the Chain Owner account, which contains 1000 SPARQ Tokens and can call ContractManager:
