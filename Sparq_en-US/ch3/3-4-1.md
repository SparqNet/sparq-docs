# 3.4.1 - Simple Contract Header

Having created the `SimpleContract` files and registered them in CMake as stated in the last subchapter, let's implement the contract's header first, as most of the registering is done there.

## Declaring the Contract Class

Open the header file (`simplecontract.h`) and add the following lines:

```cpp
#ifndef SIMPLECONTRACT_H
#define SIMPLECONTRACT_H

#include "../dynamiccontract.h"
#include "../variables/safestring.h"
#include "../variables/safetuple.h"
#include "../../utils/utils.h" // SafeUintX_t aliases declared here

class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  private:
    // ...
  public:
    // ...
};

#endif // SIMPLECONTRACT_H
```

This is a simple skeleton so we can start building the proper contract. From top to bottom:

* We create [include guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Include_guard) as a safety measure
* We include the `DynamicContract` class and two SafeVariable classes for the contract's inner variables - `SafeString`, `SafeUint256_t` and `SafeTuple`, which represent a Solidity `string`, `uint256` and `tuple/struct` types, respectively (check the `src/contract/variables` subfolder for all available variable abstractions)
    * For SafeUint (and SafeInt as well), we include `src/utils/utils.h` as all of the SafeUintX/SafeIntX aliases are declared there, if you want to use `SafeUint_t<X>`/`SafeInt_t<X>` then include `src/contract/variables/safeuint.h` (or `safeint.h`) directly instead
* We create our `SimpleContract` class, inherit it from `DynamicContract`, and leave some space for the private and public members that will be coded next

Now we can declare the members of our contract. We have to pay attention to some rules described earlier in [Chapter 3.2](3-2.md), which we'll go through slowly, one part at a time.

## Declaring the Contract Variables

Variables MUST be `private` and MUST inherit one of the SafeVariable classes. So our class declaration would start with something like this:

```cpp
class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  private:
    SafeString name_;
    SafeUint256_t value_;
    SafeTuple<std::string, uint256_t> tuple_;
  // ...
}
```

Our three variables `name_`, `value_` and `tuple_` are respectively declared as a `SafeString`, `SafeUint256_t` and `SafeTuple<std::string, uint256_t>`. Notice we can use primitive types inside the tuple just fine, as the contract's inner variables already ensure commit/revert safety due to their types being inherited from their SafeVariable counterparts.

## Declaring the Contract Functions

Functions in general can return either `void` or an ABI-supported C++ type (see the correlation on [Chapter 3.7](3-7.md)). The main difference between both is that **view** functions MUST be `const` (e.g. `getName() const;`), while **non-view** functions MUST NOT be `const` (e.g. `setName(std::string name);`).

For the two registering functions, `registerContract()` MUST be `public static void`, and `registerContractFunctions()` MUST be `private void override`.

```cpp
class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  private:
    SafeString name_;
    SafeUint256_t value_;
    void registerContractFunctions() override;

  public:
    std::string getName() const;
    uint256_t getValue() const;
    std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t> getTuple() const;
    void setName(const std::string& argName);
    void setValue(uint256_t argValue);
    void setTuple(const std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t>& argTuple);

    static void registerContract() {
      ...
    }
};
```

Just like with the tuple variable, we can use primitive types and returns on functions just fine, for the same reasons stated above. This also extends to constructors, whch we'll see below.

## Declaring the Contract Constructor and Destructor

Like any C++ derived class, we must call its base class constructor and pass the proper arguments to it (besides the arguments for the derived class itself) so it can be constructed properly.

Any contract derived from `DynamicContract` MUST have a destructor marked as `override` (so the compiler knows we are overriding the base class destructor and can properly call it), AND *two* constructors (one for creating a new contract from scratch, and another for loading the contract from the database).

```cpp
class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  // ...
  public:
    // Constructor from scratch. Create new contract with given name and value.
    SimpleContract(
      const std::string& name,
      uint256_t value,
      const std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t>& tuple,
      ContractManagerInterface &interface,
      const Address& address,
      const Address& creator,
      const uint64_t& chainId,
      const std::unique_ptr<DB> &db
    );

    // Constructor from load. Load contract from database.
    SimpleContract(
      ContractManagerInterface &interface,
      const Address& address,
      const std::unique_ptr<DB> &db
    );

    // Destructor.
    ~SimpleContract() override;

    // ...
}
```

Aside from our `name`, `value` and `tuple` variables, both constructors also take a few other arguments required by the base DynamicContract constructor:

```cpp
// Constructor that creates the contract from scratch
DynamicContract(
  const std::string& contractName,
  ContractManagerInterface &interface,
  const Address& address,
  const Address& creator,
  const uint64_t& chainId,
  const std::unique_ptr<DB> &db
);

// Constructor that loads the contract from the database
DynamicContract(
  ContractManagerInterface &interface,
  const Address& address,
  const std::unique_ptr<DB> &db
);
```

`interface`, `address`, `creator`, `chainId` and `db` are internal variables used by the base class, and should *always* be declared *last*. They are equivalent to:

| DynamicContract constructor argument | Taken from                                   |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| interface                            | this->interface                              |
| address                              | derived using this->deriveContractAddress()  |
| creator                              | this->getCaller()                            |
| chainId                              | this->options->getChainID()                  |
| DB                                   | this->db                                     |

Keep in mind that, when calling the base class constructor later on, the `contractName` argument MUST be EXACTLY the same as your contract's class name. This is because `contractName` is used to load the contract type from the database, so incorrectly naming it will result in a segfault at load time.

## Declaring the Contract Events

Events MUST be `public` and `void`, AND call an internal function named `emitEvent()`, which is available to all Dynamic Contracts and does the proper emission of the event.

```cpp
class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  private:
    SafeString name_; ///< The name of the contract.
    SafeUint256_t value_; ///< The value of the contract.
    void registerContractFunctions() override; ///< Register the contract functions.

  protected:
    /// Event for when the name changes.
    void nameChanged(const EventParam<std::string, true>& name) {
      this->emitEvent(__func__,  std::make_tuple(name));
    }

    /// Event for when the value changes.
    void valueChanged(const EventParam<uint256_t, true>& value) {
      this->emitEvent(__func__, std::make_tuple(value));
    }

    /// Event for when the name and value tuple changes.
    void tupleChanged(const EventParam<std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t>, true>& tuple) {
      this->emitEvent(__func__, std::make_tuple(tuple));
    }

  // ...
}
```

`emitEvent()`requires at most three arguments:

* The event name (you can just pass `__func__` which is the same as `this->emitEvent("nameChanged", ...)`)
* **(Optional)** A tuple of `EventParam` objects representing the event's arguments, where:
    * The first element is the argument type (e.g. `name` is a `std::string`, `value` is a `uint256_t`, `tuple` is a `std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t>`)
    * The second element is a bool that indicates whether the argument should be indexed or not.
    * If your event has no arguments at all you can omit it or pass an empty tuple instead (e.g. `this->emitEvent(__func__, std::make_tuple())`)
* **(Optional)** A flag that indicates whether the event is anonymous or not. Events are non-anonymous by default, so if you wish you can omit this (which is the case for our example, it is equivalent to `this->emitEvent(__func__, std::make_tuple(name, true), false)` - if it was an anonymous event, the last flag would be `true` instead)

## Registering the Contract Class

One last thing we have to do within our header is properly register the contract class. All Dynamic Contracts use reflections/metaprogramming to automate most of the hard work for both our contract and the ContractManager class.

First, define a `public` tuple called `ConstructorArguments` with the contract's variable types from its first constructor (the one from scratch - in our example, name is `const std::string&`, value is `uint256_t`, tuple is `const std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t>`):

```cpp
class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  // ...
  public:
    using ConstructorArguments = std::tuple<
      const std::string&, const uint256_t&, const std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t>&
    >;
    // ...
}
```

Then, implement the `registerContract()` function declared previously by calling another function from `ContractReflectionInterface` called `registerContractMethods()`, passing a few arguments to it, like this:

```cpp
class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  public:
    // ...
    static void registerContract() {
      ContractReflectionInterface::registerContractMethods<
        SimpleContract, const std::string&, const uint256_t&, const std::tuple<std::string, uint256_t>&,
        ContractManagerInterface&,
        const Address&, const Address&, const uint64_t&,
        const std::unique_ptr<DB>&
      >(
        std::vector<std::string>{"name_", "value_", "tuple_"},
        std::make_tuple("getName", &SimpleContract::getName, FunctionTypes::View
, std::vector<std::string>{}),
        std::make_tuple("getValue", &SimpleContract::getValue, FunctionTypes::View
, std::vector<std::string>{}),
        std::make_tuple("getTuple", &SimpleContract::getTuple, FunctionTypes::View, std::vector<std::string>{}),
        std::make_tuple("setName", &SimpleContract::setName, FunctionTypes::NonPayable
, std::vector<std::string>{"argName"}),
        std::make_tuple("setValue", &SimpleContract::setValue, FunctionTypes::NonPayable
, std::vector<std::string>{"argValue"}),
        std::make_tuple("setTuple", &SimpleContract::setTuple, FunctionTypes::NonPayable, std::vector<std::string>{"argTuple"})
      );
    }
}
```

Inside the chevrons (`registerContractMethods<...>()`):

* The first argument is the contract's class type (in this case, `SimpleContract`)
* The following arguments are all the types of arguments inside its first constructor (from scratch - the same ones that were put inside `ConstructorArguments`) - you can copy-paste the constructor's arguments as-is and take out the names
    * It's important to remember that contract arguments should be declared *before* the internal arguments used by the base class constructor, as stated in the previous step

Inside the parentheses (`registerContractMethods<>(...)`):

* The first argument is a string vector that is a list of all the exact names of the arguments in the constructor, each one separated by a comma - in this case, `"name_"`, `"value_"` and `tuple_`
  * Note this does not include arguments used by the base class' constructor (e.g. `interface`, `address`, `creator`, `chainId`, `db`), only the ones inherent to the contract itself
* The following arguments are tuples, one for each function from the contract, that contain respectively:
  * The exact name of the function (`"getName"`)
  * A reference to the function itself (`&SimpleContract::getName`)
  * The [state mutability](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#state-mutability) of said function, accessed by a `FunctionTypes` enum (available values are `"View"`, `"NonPayable"` and `"Payable"`)
  * A string vector that is the list of arguments that the function takes, if any (or a blank list if none)

Every contract MUST have both `ConstructorArguments` *and* `registerContract()` implemented in order to be registered, even if `ConstructorArguments` is empty (has no arguments at all).

If your contract has events, you should also register them - even though that's not exactly required, as events can be declared and emitted just fine without any kind of registration. *But*, as you'll probably need their ABI, as stated in the next step, it's highly recommended that you register your events so their ABI can be generated as well.

Events are registered the same way as the contract class and its functions, but using a separate function from `ContractReflectionInterface` called `registerContractEvents()`.

```cpp
class SimpleContract : public DynamicContract {
  public:
    // ...
    static void registerContract() {
      // registerContract() called here
      ContractReflectionInterface::registerContractEvents<SimpleContract>(
        std::make_tuple("nameChanged", false, &SimpleContract::nameChanged, std::vector<std::string>{"name"}),
        std::make_tuple("valueChanged", false, &SimpleContract::valueChanged, std::vector<std::string>{"value"}),
        std::make_tuple("tupleChanged", false, &SimpleContract::tupleChanged, std::vector<std::string>{"tuple"})
      );
    }
}
```

Inside the chevrons (`registerContractEvents<...>()`), the only argument is the contract's class name (in this case, `SimpleContract`).

Inside the parentheses (`registerContractEvents<>(...)`):

* The first argument is the event's name (`"nameChanged"`)
* The second argument is a flag indicating whether the event is anonymous or not
* The third argument is a reference to the event itself (`&SimpleContract::nameChanged`)
* The last argument is a string vector that is the list of parameters that the event takes, if any (or a blank list if none)

Finally, we go to the `src/contract/customcontracts.h` file, include our contract's header and add it to the `ContractTypes` tuple.
