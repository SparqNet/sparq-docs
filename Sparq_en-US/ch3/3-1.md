# 3.1 - Contracts in Sparq

Contracts in Sparq work similar to Solidity contracts - developers can implement diverse logic structures within the network, and directly interact with the blockchain's current state. At the same time, they differ significantly from those in EVM blockchains. While we provide the same functionality as Solidity, we also break away from the "rules" of VM contracts, allowing more flexibility and power.

The main difference being, in Sparq, contracts are *native, compiled C++ code*. This means we can take advantage of the absence of an EVM and its constraints, have full control of the contract's logic and unleash blazing fast performance. This chapter will comprehensively cover creating new contracts for Sparq using OrbiterSDK.

In general terms, to create a contract from scratch, you must:

* Develop the contract's logic in C++
* Manually code several methods to parse arguments of transactions calling your contract
* Use the database to manage the storage of your local variables

The rules explained throughout this chapter ensure that contracts remain compatible with frontend Web3 tools (e.g. MetaMask, ethers.js, web3.js, etc.). Those are designed to interact with Solidity contracts and thus require a similar interface.

To call your contract's functions from a frontend, you'll need to generate its ABI - you can either do it directly with our generator tool (explained further in [Chapter 3.4](3-4.md)), or replicate their definitions in Solidity and use an external tool like Ethereum's [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or any other of your preference. This ABI can then be used by your preferred Web3 frontend.

## Types of Contracts

OrbiterSDK offers two types of contracts: **Dynamic Contracts** (`DynamicContract` in `src/contract/dynamiccontract.h`) and **Protocol Contracts** (`BaseContract` in `src/contract/contract.h`). The differences between both types come from how they are created and managed within the SDK.

### Dynamic Contracts (recommended)

* Can only be handled by the `ContractManager` class (see below), which enables the chain owner to create an unlimited number of Dynamic Contracts
* Must use special types called **SafeVariables** - an additional layer of protection that allows a better control on whether variable changes are commited to the state or automatically reverted when necessary (e.g. when a transaction fails/throws)
* Can only be called when a block is being processed
* Are directly loaded into memory and work very similarly to Solidity contracts, including the ability to emit events

OrbiterSDK provides ready-to-use templates for the following Dynamic Contracts:

* `ERC20` (template for an ERC20 token)
* `ERC20Wrapper` (template for an ERC20 wrapper)
* `ERC721` (template for an ERC721 token)
* `NativeWrapper` (template for a native asset wrapper)
* `SimpleContract` (template for a simple contract, used exclusively for testing and teaching purposes)
* `DEXV2Factory` (template for a DEX factory)
* `DEXV2Library` (namespace for commonly used DEX functions)
* `DEXV2Pair` (template for a DEX contract pair)
* `DEXV2Router02` (template for a DEX contract router)
* `UQ112x112` (namespace for dealing with fixed point fractions in DEX contracts)
* `ThrowTestA/B/C` (contracts for testing nested call revert functionality)

### Protocol Contracts

* Are directly integrated into the blockchain, therefore not linked to the `ContractManager` class and not contained by it, which removes some restrictions but adds others (see [Chapter 3.6](3-6.md))
* Can be designed to process information beyond transaction calls, communicate with other nodes, access files within the current system, and even automatically call themselves when certain conditions are met - anytihng is possible, as long as you don't break your own blockchain (more on that later)
* Cannot use SafeVariables *or* emit events, as they only work with Dynamic Contracts - so it's all up to you (for the most part) as to where to place the contract's variables and their commit/revert logic within the source code of the blockchain

## Managing contracts

Contracts in OrbiterSDK are managed by a few classes working together:

* `ContractManager` is responsible for handling the ownership of all contracts registered within the blockchain, as well as their global variables (contract name, address, owner, balance, etc.), emission and management of events
* `ContractManagerInterface`is responsible for allowing contracts to interact with each other and to enable them to modify balances - this kind of inter-communication is done by intercepting calls of functions from registered contracts (if the functor/signature matches), which is done using either one of the following ways:
  * Taking an `eth_call` request as input
  * Taking a transaction as input (for State when processing blocks)
  * Taking a fully constructed `ethCallInfo` as input to simulate a transaction (for RPC to answer `eth_estimateGas` to let the user know if the transaction is going to revert or not)
* `ContractFactory` is responsible for handling contract creation and registration
* `ContractCallLogger` is responsible for managing alterations of data like contract variables and account balances during nested contract call chains, automatically committing or reverting changes made to the account state when necessary

The `ContractManager` class itself is a Protocol Contract, but it does not own or create any Protocol Contracts. Instead, they are created during blockchain initialization, and a reference to each of them is stored within the class, allowing it to access them directly.

Dynamic Contracts, however, are fully owned and stored in a `std::unordered_map<Address,std::unique_ptr<DynamicContract>>`. This ensures that each contract has a unique address, which is derived using a similar scheme as EVM. You can get a list of currently registered contracts by calling `getContracts()`, which returns a list of the respective contract names and their addresses.

Because of this, `ContractManager` doesn't necessarily know the type of the contract stored within the pointer - it only needs to know the contract during either creating it or loading it from the database. This is why all contracts inherit the `BaseContract` class, as it contains a `name_` variable specifying the name of the contract. This name must be the same as the name of the class, as it is used to identify the contract during loading and creation.

The reason for using `ContractManagerInterface` for contract inter-communication instead of accessing`ContractManager` or the state directly is to be able to do it in an isolated and secure way. For example, if we want to send tokens from a contract to another address, we don't access the balance directly from the state. Every time a function is called by a **user** (not another contract), the balances map available for contracts is empty, only populating what is currently being accessed and not previously available. When modifying the balance, only the mapping within `ContractCallLogger` is modified, therefore allowing for multiple nested contract functions to revert in an atomic fashon while not affecting either the state or other contracts altogether.

## SafeVariables and commit/revert logic

In C++, when you call a function that changes a variable and then throw an exception later, the changed variable is *not* reverted automatically. Consider the following example:

```c++
MyClass::updateValueAndThrow(const uint64_t key, const uint64_t value) {
  // Suppose the original value of myMap[key] is 5
  this->myMap[key] = value; // e.g. 10
  throw std::runtime_error("Error");
  // myMap[key] is now 10, but it shouldn't be because it threw
}
```

Even if you use a try/catch block, the value of `myMap[key]` will be permanently changed and won't roll back on its own, because that's how C++ works - it doesn't go out of its way to do things you didn't specified it to do. You would have to manually roll this logic by storing the old value in a temporary variable before changing it, and implementing specific logic to assign it back again in case of an error. The previous example could theoretically be coded like this:

```c++
MyClass::updateValueAndThrow(const uint64_t key, const uint64_t value) {
  const uint64_t oldValue = this->myMap[key]; // Store the old value of myMap[key] first
  try {
    this->myMap[key] = value; // myMap[key] is now 10
    throw std::runtime_error("Error"); // Something went wrong
  } catch (std::exception& e) {
    this->mMap[key] = oldValue; // Assign the original value back, myMap[key] is now 5 again
  }
}
```

For Protocol Contracts, that's pretty much the gist of it. Dynamic Contracts, however, automatically provide said functionality with the use of special types called **SafeVariables**, declared inside the `src/contract/variables` folder.

All SafeVariables inherit from the `SafeBase` class, which adheres to the following rules:

* Has two internal variables: one for the original value and another that is a pointer to a temporary value
* Must override the `check()`, `commit()`, and `revert()` functions
  * `check()` should verify if the temporary value is `nullptr`; if it is, it should set the temporary value to the original value
  * `commit()` should copy the temporary value to the original value
  * `revert()` should set the temporary value to `nullptr`
* Must be declared as *private* within contracts and initialized with `this` as the parameter - this enables the SafeVariable to mark itself as used in the `ContractManager`, allowing proper reversion of changes made to the contract
* Must call `check()` and return the temporary value (or reference to the temporary value)
* If non-`const`, must call `markAsUsed()` when accessed, allowing the contract to properly register the variable as used within the function call, and properly revert or commit changes made to the contract accordingly

Each Dynamic Contract includes a vector of references to SafeVariables, which is used to register used variables within a specific function call.

### Types of SafeVariables

We provide the following SafeVariable types, declared in `src/contracts/variables`:

* `SafeAddress` - abstracts a 20-byte address
* `SafeArray` - abstracts an array
* `SafeBool` - abstracts a boolean
* `SafeInt` and `SafeUint` - abstract a range of signed/unsigned integers (see [Chapter 3.7](3-7.md))
* `SafeString` - abstracts a string (either literal or raw bytes)
* `SafeTuple` - abstracts a tuple/struct of any type
* `SafeUnorderedMap` - abstracts a mapping
* `SafeVector` - abstracts a vector

### Caveats with safe containers

Containers have some exceptions to these rules. Copying the entire container would be prohibitively expensive, so only accessed values are copied to the temporary container. This means they do not behave like regular containers, requiring developers to exercise caution when using iterators or looping through them.

Our `SafeUnorderedMap` variable allows limited looping through the container. This limitation is due to the inability to access both the original and temporary containers simultaneously; you can only access one at a time. It is recommended to loop through a container within a `const` function, as this will not modify the temporary container.

`SafeUnorderedMap` includes the following functions for looping through both containers:

| Function    | Description                                                           | Return type     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| cbegin()    | Returns a const iterator to the beginning of the original container   | const_iterator  |
| cend()      | Returns a const iterator to the end of the original container         | const_iterator  |
| begin()     | Returns a const iterator to the beginning of the temporary container  | iterator        |
| end()       | Returns a const iterator to the end of the temporary container        | iterator        |
| empty()     | Returns true both the original and temporary container is empty       | bool            |
| size()      | Returns the size of the original container                            | size_type       |
| tempSize()  | Returns the size of the temporary container                           | size_type       |

Keep in mind that the temporary and original containers are not the same, so duplicates within `size()` and `tempSize()` are possible.
