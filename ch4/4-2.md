# 4.2 - Merkle and Patricia Trees

The Sparq project contains a custom implementation of Merkle and Patricia trees, adapted from the following sites:

* https://medium.com/coinmonks/implementing-merkle-tree-and-patricia-tree-b8badd6d9591
* https://lab.miguelmota.com/merkletreejs/example/

Those structures are frequently called "Merkle"/"Patricia", "Merkle Trie"/"Patricia Trie", "Merkle Tree"/"Patricia Tree", etc.

## Concepts

It's recommended to read the articles to better understand the concepts, but to sum it up, they're both data structures in binary tree format (e.g. "heap sort"), where data is stored on the "leaves", and the "branches" are paths to reach said data.

The difference between both structures is in the "branches"' (and also the "root"'s) behaviour:

* A **Merkle tree** is mainly used for **verification** - it hashes the previous layers in pairs to make new layers, bottom-up, until it reaches a single result which would be the "root" of the tree - this makes the root a unique fingerprint for the tree as a whole, thus you only need to check the root hash to verify that the tree, including its leaves, are intact.
* A **Patricia Tree** is mainly used for **storage** - it breaks the leaf's data in several pieces and uses said pieces to build a branch path that leads to the leaf - for example, a string can be cut into individual characters, and every character becomes a branch node, where the whole branch becomes a "key" that leads to a unique value.

The Ethereum project uses a "customized combination" of both trees, called MPT ("Merkle Patricia Tree"), for several things - storing the database state, transaction recepits, etc.. Sparq's objective with the implementation of both trees is to simulate this combination uniting the benefits of both structures.

## Implementations and class members

Sparq implements those structures spearately, in two classes: `Merkle` and `Patricia`.

Their nodes are abstracted by the classes `Hash` (for `Merkle`, declared in Utils) and `PNode` (for `Patricia`, declared internally by the class itself for exclusive use - the clss still uses `Hash` for inserts, searches and deletions).

The `Merkle` class:
* Has tree members that form the tree - the root (root), the complete tree with all layers bottom-up/from leafs to root (layers), and the leaves (leafs)
* The constructor requires a leaf vector, a `std::map` of block transactions, or a `std::map` of Validator transactions
* Each member has its getter - `root()`, `layers()` and `leafs()`
* It's possible to check the integrity of one of the leaves using the `getProof()` method, which returns the verification path of a given leaf, bottom-up

The `Patricia` class:
* Has only one member that forms the tree - a `PNode` containing the root of the tree
* Each `PNode` has a single character that serves as an ID and a vector of children `PNode`s, therefore we only need the root to go through the whole tree and reach the leaves (the constructor hardcodes the root tree to the **/** character ID)
* The tree can be manipulated with the functions `add()`, `get()` and `remove()`
  * `add()` inserts a value in the tree based on a certain `Hash`
  * `get()` searches a value inside a certain `Hash`
  * `remove()` deletes a value inside a certain `Hash` (the branch nodes themselves are NOT deleted, only their data)
