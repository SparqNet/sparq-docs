# 2.3 - Block

Blocks on the SparqNet are abstracted by the **Block** class in `core/block`.

The class only has the structure and data of a block, it doesn't do any kind of operation, validation or verification on it.

## Block structure

Conceptually, a block has the following structure:

* Validator signature
* Header:
  * Previous block hash (= a hash of the whole header, signed by the Validator)
  * "Randomness" (TODO: explain better)
  * Validator Merkle Tree (to verify the integrity of Validator transactions)
  * Block Merkle Tree (to verify the integrity of block transactions)
  * UNIX timestamp of the block, in nanoseconds
  * Block height (nHeight)
* Content:
  * Number of Validator transactions
  * Number of block transactions
  * List of Validator transactions
  * List of block transactions

In practice, a block is simply a serialized bytes string, transmitted through the network and stored in the blockchain, therefore it's up to the code logic to parse said details.

The above structure can be interpreted in a "simpler" form:

```
65 bytes - Validator signature
Header:
  32 bytes - Previous block hash
  32 bytes - "Randomness"
  32 bytes - Validator Merkle Tree
  32 bytes - Block Merkle Tree
  8 bytes - Timestamp
  8 bytes - Block height
Content:
  8 bytes - Number of Validator transactions
  8 bytes - Number of block transactions
  8 bytes - Offset of Validator transactions array
  8 bytes - Offset of block transactions array
  [
    4 bytes - Validator transaction size
    N bytes - Validator transaction
    ...
  ]
  [
    4 bytes - Block transaction size
    N bytes - Block transaction
    ...
  ]
```

Blocks transmitted on the network *must* have the Validator signature, which is part of the block but is *outside* its structure. This is intentional, so the block header can be hashed and signed without interference from the signature itself.

## Raw block analysis

That said, a "raw" block would look like this:

TODO: I don't know which example is right, if a byte is counted two-by-two or one-by-one, or if the example block is actually right to begin with. I've left both example here for analysis.
