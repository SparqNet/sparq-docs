# 2.6 - Mempool/ChainTip

The mempool on the Sparq network is abstracted by the **ChainTip** class in `core/chainTip`.

The class controls blocks received through the network and contains information such as the preferred block (chosen by the network), if the block is being processed, if it was approved or rejected.

When a block reaches consensus (as in, it stops being "processed" and is either "approved" or "rejected"), it is removed from the mempool and properly discarded (if rejected) or moved to the blockchain (if approved).

A block that was already received before can't be accepted anymore. This applies to every status a block can be in, and to prevent that from happening, the status of all received blocks is stored in a list (`cachedBlockStatus`).

## Initialization and class members

The class does not have a defined constructor, it is initialized in a pointer in `Subnet::initialize`.

The class has the following internal variables:

* `Hash preferedBlockHash` - the preferred block (TODO: explain this better)
* `unordered_map<Hash, Block*, SafeHash> internalChainTip` - the mempool itself
* `unordered_map<Hash, BlockStatus, SafeHash> cachedBlockStatus` - the list of all statuses from received blocks

Subsequently, during the process of accepting a block, the stored data is copied to a new block and added to the blockchain.

The member functions of the class are:

* **setBlockStatus** - changes the status of a block in `cachedBlockStatus`
  * **NOTE**: This method is not called anywhere in the code
* **getBlockStatus** - return the state of a block in `cachedBlockStatus`, if it exists in the mempool
* **processBlock** - add the block received from the network to the `internalChainTip` and `cachedBlockStatus` lists, to be processed in the next network operations
* **isProcessing** - verifies if a block is being processed, returning the block state or `false` if the block is not found or is not `BlockStatus::Processing`
* **accept** - accepts a given block according to the network's request
  * If the block was verified before and is not being processed, it is sent to `State::processNewBlock` and added to the blockchain
  * TODO: there was a link to "state.md" here, since it's not clear where this file goes, the link was removed for now
* **reject** - rejects a given block according to the network's request
* **exists** - verifies if the block exists in `internalChainTip`
* **getBlock** - returns a block added to the mempool before, or an uncaught exception if it doesn't exist
* **getPreference** - returns the `Hash` of the best candidate block selected by the network, or an uncaught exception if it doesn't exist
* **setPreference** - changes the best block selected by the network
