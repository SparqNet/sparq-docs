# 2.1 - Implementation overview

The Sparq blockchain structure is composed of the inteaction between the following components:

* [Transaction](2-2.md) - implemented as **Tx::Base** in `utils/transaction`
* [Block](2-3.md) - implemented as **Block** in `core/block`
* Validator - implemented as **Validator** in `core/blockmanager`
* BlockManager  - implemented as **BlockManager** in `core/blockmanager`
* [Mempool/ChainTip](2-6.md) - implemented as **ChainTip** in `core/chainTip`
* [Blockchain/ChainHead](2-7.md) - implemented as **ChainHead** in `core/chainHead`

TODO:
1) names are confusing for newcomers, I would sincerely think about renaming them ASAP for consistency:
- **Tx::Base** could become just **Tx**, it's literally a class inside a namespace that has NOTHING but this very class
- **ChainHead** could become just **Chain** or **Blockchain**
- **ChainTip** could become just **Mempool** (because that's literally what it is)
2) eliminate the topics below as they become their own files
3) finish linking the rest of the topics in the tables of content

## Validator

The Validator class is an abstraction of a validator node. A Validator node is a node that validates blocks and their transactions from the network.

TODO: lacking more info on how it works and what it does

## BlockManager

The BlockManager class manages block creation, congestion and validation.

The process is made by an internal list of Validators, of which one is selected to create the block and the others validate it using signatures.

TODO: some things are not clear enough:

- "BlockManager is also considered a contract, but remains part of the core protocol of Sparq"- ???
- Is the Validator selection really random? Code doesn't say much
- `processBlock()` is implemented here but not in ChainTip (code cruft?????)
