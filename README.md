# Introduction

This document and other derivatives will explain and introduce the developer to the application, the file structure imitates the same architecture until the moment and will be updated constantly so don't find it strange, the file definitions will be minimalist and even informal since familiarity will be considered by those who read.

These documents can be accessed at any moment and out of order, in some cases there will be **UML** examples when one or several classes interact to represent behavior.

This document is written and maintained by the developers [Jean-Lessa](https://github.com/Jean-Lessa) and [GabrielVilarinho](https://github.com/GabrielVilarinho).
